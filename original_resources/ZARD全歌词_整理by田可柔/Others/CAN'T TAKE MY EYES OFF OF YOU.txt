CAN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF OF YOU
×÷´Ê/×÷Çú/±àÇú£ºFrankie Vailli

You're just to good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch 
Oh I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And i thank god i'm alive
You just to good to be true
Oh can't take my eyes off of you

Pardon the way that i stare.
There's nothin' eles to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like i feel
Woo then let me know that it's real
You just to good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you baby
And if it's quite alright
I need you baby 
To warm a lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when i say
Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down i pray
Oh pretty baby
No that i found you stay
And let me love you baby
Let me love you
