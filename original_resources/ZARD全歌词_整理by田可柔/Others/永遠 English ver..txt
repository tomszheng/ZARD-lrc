If see you'll view in feeling red's explain  
I hope you remembers me all the days  
you spent with me  

We'll never use this someday lead to mind  
We can trip to the wedding sereral ways you and i 
  
What shinning says on cross travel in raining to night  
Together we sure find secret land your love  
  
Oh can you tell me if still line between us  
"If time did wait call on but I'm in sweet love¡±  

If having never seen the meaning on love  

There nothing on worth do all lose  
And ever we are free 

Just to believe into i can 


--------------------------------

If you see a beautiful bletting laid out of the vine
I hope it remains me all the days you spent with me
Wherever you decided and made up your mind
We can treat with a read and say on weeds
you and I

Make us shiny sands of glass
Be frail into white
Together we shall find out a secret land of love

Oh darllin', tell me if this's still between us
It's something which I call everlasting love
If I've been never see the meaning of love
There's nothing of worth than do all lose
I'll never be afraid ,just to be with you again
