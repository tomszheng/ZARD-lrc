<i><p>Kimagure na kugatsu no ame ni<br>
Shiroi kasa no shoujo ga surechigau<br>
Sagashiteta futari no yukue<br>
Ima wa mada shiritakunai<br>
Anata no yurikago no naka sotto nemuritai<br>
Kokoro ni himeta namida wasure</p>

<p>Mou sukoshi, ato sukoshi aisaretai<br>
Ikenai koi to shittemo<br>
Mou sukoshi anata no koto komarasetai<br>
Kono ai tomerarenai</p>

<p>Omoide no Kobe no machi de<br>
Anata e no tegami shitatamete imasu<br>
Wasureyou to nando mo shita wa<br>
Sono hou ga raku ni naru<br>
Tsuishin: anata no umareta ie wo mite kimashita<br>
Nandaka setsunakute natsukashikatta</p>

<p>Mou sukoshi, ato sukoshi soba ni itai<br>
Kanawanu yume to shittemo<br>
Sou sukoshi ano hito yori deau toki ga<br>
Ososugita dake na no</p>

<p>Mou sukoshi, ato sukoshi aisaretai<br>
Ikenai koi to shittemo<br>
Mou sukoshi anata no koto komarasetai<br>
Kono ai tomerarenai</p>

<p><b>English</b></p>

<p>In the fickle September rain<br>
Little girls with white umbrellas pass by<br>
I've searched for where our relationship went<br>
But I still don't want to find out<br>
I want to quietly sleep in your cradle<br>
And forget the tears I've hidden in my heart</p>

<p>Just a bit more, just a bit longer I want to be loved<br>
Even though I know it's a love that cannot be<br>
Just a bit more, I want to be troubled by you<br>
I can't stop this love</p>

<p>In the streets of Kobe that I remembered<br>
I'm writing a letter to you<br>
I've tried to forget you so many times<br>
That way, I could be happy<br>
P.S.: I went to see the house you were born in<br>
It was kind of sad, and nostalgic</p>

<p>Just a bit more, just a bit longer, I want to be by you<br>
Though I know it's an unreachable dream<br>
Just a bit, more than her, our meeting<br>
Was just a little too late</p>

<p>Just a bit more, just a bit longer I want to be loved<br>
Even though I know it's a love that cannot be<br>
Just a bit more, I want to be troubled by you<br>
I can't stop this love</p>
