<p><b>English</b></p>
 
<p>Although it'd be nice if the words would come out fluently<br>
Like when I write a letter to a friend<br>
What I want is more time for us to get to know each other<br>
It's so lonely when the only ones I won't betray<br>
Are my family; Love is asking to be loved<br>
Though I know that I'd be better off <br>
If I stopped believing</p>

<p>Don't you see!<br>
Even though I wish and pray for miracles and memories<br>
I'm a bit worried<br>
Don't you see!<br>
If I act a little disillusioned <br>
It's because I'm afraid of being hurt</p>

<p>The silence while we were waiting at the taxi stop<br>
Was only five minutes, but felt so much longer<br>
I never thought that our relationship<br>
Would have grown this tired and faded</p>

<p>Don't you see!<br>
I'm relieved because we're the type of couple<br>
Who won't give up because of a small fight<br>
Don't you see! <br>
More than seeing various other people<br>
I always want to see the same old you</p>

<p>Don't you see! I'll never worry, tonight<br>
I'll lay me down tonight.<br>
You know, I do it for you.</p> 

<p>Don't you see! <br>
The smell of your town <br>
As we walk beneath the roadside trees at dusk<br>
Don't you see! <br>
No matter how much of a rush <br>
The rest of the world is in, hold on to me</p>
