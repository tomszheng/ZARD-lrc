<i><p>Moshi tsubasa ga atta nara<br>
Mayowazu </i>forgive me, kiss me, and hold me tight<i><br>
Anata no moto eto</p>

<p>Ushinatta tsukihi ya ai wo tsurete<br>
Shigarami zembu nugisutete</p>

<p></i>Good day, and why don't you leave me alone<i><br>
Akirameru yori mo aa yasashiku naritai<br>

Naku kara kanashiku narunda to</p>

<p>Iki ga tsumarisou na kono machi<br>
"Kyou kono seikatsu ni <br>
PIRIODO wo utsu kesshin wo shita" to<br>
Kondo itsu aeru no? to kikezu ni<br>
Kotoba wa itsumo kokoro to urahara</p>

<p><b>English</b></p>

<p>If I had wings<br>
Without hesitating, forgive me, kiss me, and hold me tight<br>
As I fly to you</p>

<p>Carrying the time and love we've lost<br>
I'd throw off all restraints</p>

<p>Good day, and why don't you leave me alone<br>
More than giving up, ah, I want to become kinder<br>
Good-bye and somebody tell me why<br>
When I cry, I become sad</p>

<p>It's so stifling, this town<br>
"I've decided today <br>
That I'd put an end to this way that I'm living"<br>
Without asking when can I see you again<br>
My words are always the opposite of what I mean</p>

<p>Good day, and why don't you leave me alone<br>
More than giving up, ah, I want to become kinder<br>
Good-bye and somebody tell me why<br>
When I cry, I become sad</p>

<p>If I stay with you like this<br>
I'm sure that the day will come when we regret it</p>

<p>Good day, and why don't you leave me alone<br>
More than giving up, ah, I want to become kinder<br>
Good day, because I want to forget my weakness<br>
People will fall in love again</p>

<p>Good-bye, and why don't you leave me alone<br>
Walking endlessly in the rain was my reason to cry<br>
Good-bye, walk away, and don't you ask me why<br>
Good-bye is the only words left to us...</p>
