<p><b>English</b></p>

<p>I certainly won't forget your brilliant gaze<br>
I want to believe in you, I do believe in you<br>
So that you'll never change</p>

<p>Every day, every night<br>
Though all I did was cry<br>
Without talking to anyone<br>
Though I lack skill, with all my heart<br>
I loved you in that season<br>
The darkening town, the overflowing crowds of people<br>
Even now, you appear with a smiling face</p>

<p>I certainly won't forget, even if winter comes again<br>
Because I want to hold onto my memories<br>
I'll blow my sadness beyond those clouds<br>
I want to believe in you, I do believe in you<br>
So that you'll never change</p>

<p>Parting in the powdery snow, the loneliness<br>
Piled up in my chest, "I want to see you again"<br>
Why is it that back then, we hurt each other<br>
And did nothing but act strong<br>
Among the multitude of stars, so that we'd make it on time<br>
You always carried me past any obstacles</p>

<p>I certainly won't forget, your brilliant gaze<br>
Even though the promise I long for is painful<br>
No matter how far apart we are, my heart will go on<br>
I want to give up, I won't give up<br>
Loneliness will knock on my door</p>

<p>I certainly won't forget, even if winter comes again<br>
Because I want to hold onto my memories<br>
I'll blow my sadness beyond those clouds<br>
I want to believe in you, I do believe in you<br>
So that you'll never change</p>
