<i><p>Nee, sonna ni shaberanakutemo<br>
Watashi wa waratte irareru kara<br>
Mou aenai ki ga shite...<br>
Dare mo inai eki no HOOMU<br>
Sorezore no fuyu erabi omoide ni te wo futta</p>

<p>Anata wo kanjite itai<br>
Tatoe tooku hanarete itemo<br>
Tokimeku kokoro tomenaide<br>
Minna mienai ashita wo sagashite iru<br>
Yakusoku nante nanimo nai kedo<br>
Kawaranai futari de iyou ne</p>

<p>Furueru kuchibiru fusaide<br>
Wakaregiwa iikaketa kotoba ni<br>
Mou aenai ki ga shita...<br>
Hitori aruku machi-juu ga <br>
Nijinda KYANDORU de ippai setsunakute</p>

<p>Anata wo kanjite itai<br>
Shiroi toiki no kisetsu no naka de<br>
Ima sugu tonde yukitai kedo<br>
Subete wo sutete yukenai watashi ga iru<br>
Kuchi ni dasanai yasashisa ga itai<br>
Mado no soto mo yuki ni kawatta</p>

<p>Anata wo kanjite itai<br>
Gin iro no kisetsu no naka de<br>
Kagayaki tsuzukete hoshii<br>
Dakedo tokai no SUPIIDO ni nagasarenaide<br>
"Matte iru kara" to doushite ano toki<br>
Sunao ni ienakatta no darou...</p>

<p><b>English</b></p>

<p>It's okay if you don't talk that much<br>
Because I can still smile<br>
I've a feeling I can't see you anymore...<br>
The platform at the train station was deserted<br>
I waved goodbye to those winter choices and memories</p>

<p>I want to feel you<br>
Even if you're far away<br>
Without stopping my anxious heart<br>
I'm searching for a tomorrow that no one can see<br>
I don't have any promises<br>
But let's stay together unchangingly</p>

<p>I pursed together my quivering lips<br>
Over words I started to say as we were about to part<br>
I'd a feeling I couldn't see you anymore...<br>
The town I walked through alone<br>
Was filled with melted candles and was painful</p>

<p>I want to feel you<br>
In the middle of this season of white breath<br>
Even though I want to run to you soon<br>
I can't throw it all away<br>
Kindness that can't be put into words causes pain<br>
The scene outside the window has changed to snow</p>

<p>I want to feel you<br>
In the middle of this silver season<br>
I want you to continue to shine<br>
But don't get swept away by the speed of the city<br>
I wonder why it was<br>
That I couldn't honestly say "I'll wait for you"...</p>
