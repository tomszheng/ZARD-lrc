<i><p>Arukidasu sono michi wa dokoka ni tsunagatteru no?<br>
Ikutsumo no tobira wo tataite kita<br>
Utsuri yuku hito moyou shuui ga urayamu hodo<br>
Naka ga ii futari datta no ni ne</p>

<p>Marude tetsubou ni burasagatteru mitai ni<br>
Sekai ga mawaru no wo kobande itai</p>

<p>Dokidoki shita ano natsukashii SUTORII<br>
Tonari ni iru anata mo muchuu datta<br>
Togireru kotoba ikutsumo umeru you ni hashaida<br>
Yofuke no heya, mado no soto wa MONOKUROOMU</p>

<p>Nee tatoeba michibata ni saku hana wo mite<br>
"Kirei da" to omoeru uchi wa mada daijoubu<br>
Moshi ame ni nureta nara yasashiku kasa wo sashite kureta yo ne<br>
Soko ga suki datta no</p>

<p>Uso wo tsuku nara... sou saigo made<br>
Zutto zutto uso wo tsukitooshite hoshikatta</p>

<p>Tokidoki atte hanasu koto ga naku natte<br>
Koushite betsu no michi sagashiteru hou ga... shiawase da ne<br>
Kagayakeru mirai no tame ni watashi wa nakanakatta<br>
Mado no soto wa MONOKUROMU</p>

<p><b>English</b></p>

<p>Where will that road, on which we've begun to walk, lead us<br>
I've knocked on so many doors<br>
The patterns of people moving on around would envy us<br>
That was how close we had been</p>

<p>Just as if I were hanging from a metal bar<br>
I want to go against the turning of the world</p>

<p>That nostalgic story, which made my heart beat<br>
By my side, you were also caught up in it<br>
Filling the many gaps in our conversation with high spirits<br>
In that midnight room, outside the window was monochrome</p>

<p>If you were to see a flower bloom by the roadside<br>
We're still good enough to think it's pretty<br>
If I was wet with the rain, you'd hand me an umbrella<br>
That's what I liked about you</p>

<p>If you're going to lie... then do it till the end<br>
I wanted you to keep lying to me, for ever and ever</p>

<p>We don't even meet and talk anymore<br>
I guess finding our own, seperate lives is... happier<br>
For the sake of a future that could sparkle, I never cried<br>
But outside my window was monochrome</p>

<p>That nostalgic story, which made my heart beat<br>
By my side, you were also caught up in it<br>
Filling the many gaps in our conversation with high spirits<br>
In that midnight room, outside the window was monochrome</p>
