<i><p>Higure toki yoku futari de aruita ne<br>

<p><b>English</b></p>

<p>At sundown, we often walked together<br>
Through the spring days when the wind was still cold<br>
Looking skyward, those stars were shining<br>
Looking like you wanted to reach me<br>
You softly extended your hand<br>
I'm sorry for going out with him secretly<br>
If I told you sooner, would you have forgiven me?</p>

<p>Those words I couldn't say that day even now<br>
Are asleep in my heart<br>
Back then, if I'd had a bit more courage<br>
I wouldn't have had to lose you<br>
It's too late<br>
Nostalgia for days long past</p>

<p>In silence, in the photo album that caught my breath<br>
The history of an interrupted happiness<br>
We both had smiles uncaring for what tomorrow may bring<br>
Looking back at the innocent past, my heart hurts<br>
It's really hopeless, isn't it?<br>
Because it still bothers you<br>
If we had talked about it, would you have forgiven me?</P>

<p>Those words I couldn't say that day even now<br>
Are asleep in my heart<br>
Back then, if I'd been a bit more grown up<br>
I could have lived with only half the remorse<br>
But it's too late<br>
Nostalgia for days long past</p>

<p>Those words I couldn't say that day even now<br>
Are asleep in my heart<br>
Back then, if I'd had a bit more courage<br>
I wouldn't have had to lose you<br>
It's too late<br>
Nostalgia for days long past</p>
