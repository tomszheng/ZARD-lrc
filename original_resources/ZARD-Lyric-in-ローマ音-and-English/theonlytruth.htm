<p><b>Japanese</b></p>

<p>You say you'll give me a highway with no one on it</p>

<p><i>Donna toki mo ashita no koto yume mite itai ne<br>
Ashi wo tomete hitoiki tsuite<br>
Minna omoi no manma ni ayunde iru kedo<br>
Dare demo aisaretai no</p>

<p>Watashi itsumo me no mae no nanika kara nigete bakari<br>
Nanoni anata ni mukatte hashitteru</p>

<p></i>The only truth I know is you<br>
Leaves are brown now<i><br>
Kitsuku dakishimeraretara<br>
</i>The only truth I know is you<br>
And I wish you were here<i><br>
Sukoshi daitan ni ichizu na kono omoi<br>
Anata shita mienai no</p>

<p>Hagureta tori mure no kanata kaette yuku noka na<br>
Kaze ni midare kami ga kishinde<br>
Konna toko de maiko ni nattara<br>
Watashi wa hitori de ikite wa yukenai</p>

<p>Tsukarekitta genjitsu wa sugite shimaeba <br>
Tada no omoide kizuato nante itakunai</p>

<p></i>The only truth I know is you<br>
Leaves are brown now<i><br>
Shoudou ni shoujiki de itai<br>
</i>The only truth I know is you<br>
Leaves are brown now<i><br>
Sukoshi daitan ni kisu shite ii no ni<br>
Asa ga kuru mae ni</p>

<p>Koukai shite ita<br>
Wasureyou to shite ita<br>
Yasashii ame ga namida ni kawatta...</p>

<p><b>English</b></p>

<p>You say you'll give me a highway with no one on it</p>

<p>No matter when, I want to dream of tomorrow<br>
Stopping my steps, I take a breath<br>
Though everyone is walking in their own way<br>
They all want to be loved</p>

<p>I was always just running from something before my eyes<br>
But, I was running towards you</p>

<p>The only truth I know is you<br>
Leaves are brown now<br>
If only I could be held tightly by you<br>
The only truth I know is you<br>
And I wish you were here<br>
Just a bit boldly, with these single-minded feelings<br>
I can't see anything but you</p>

<p>A bird astray, can it find it's way back to the crowd?<br>
Mussed by the wind, my hair is in discord<br>
If I were to become lost in a place like this<br>
I know I couldn't go on alone</p>

<p>If this tired reality were to pass on<br>
Mere memories and scars wouldn't hurt</p>

<p>The only truth I know is you<br>
Leaves are brown now<br>
I want to be true to my impulses<br>
The only truth I know is you<br>
Leaves are brown now<br>
It would be alright if you kissed me a bit boldly<br>
Before the morning comes</p>

<p>I regretted it<br>
I tried to forget it<br>
The gentle rain turned into tears...</p>

<p>The only truth I know is you<br>
Leaves are brown now<br>
If only I could be held tightly by you<br>
The only truth I know is you<br>
And I wish you were here<br>
Just a bit boldly, with these single-minded feelings<br>
I can't see anything but you</p>
