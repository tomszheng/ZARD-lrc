<p><b>English</b></p>

<p>Even in this city which I had loved so much<br>
There's nothing I can immerse myself into<br>
The open lot I had looked at from my veranda<br>
Will soon be lined with buildings, changed completely</p>

<p>You're free to choose where you go<br>
But at least be smiling when you appear in my dreams<br>
Ah, on the morning I woke up, there was a gray, cloudy sky<br>
It seemed kind of like my own feelings which would not clear</p>

<p>Even the things I could say because I didn't know better<br>
When I learn too much, I find I can't say them anymore<br>
There isn't anyone who ever showed my their hearts that much<br>
I want you to see that my rough talking is just a front</p>

<p>I wonder how we could return to how we were long ago<br>
The seasons will completely carry us away<br>
Ah, on the morning I woke up, there was a blue rain<br>
The first thing I thought of the entire day was your face</p>

<p>Ah, I have to hurry and give chase<br>
Because you're passing right before my eyes<br>
Ah, the train that's started running won't turn around<br>
I had wanted to confess, that "I still love you"</p>
