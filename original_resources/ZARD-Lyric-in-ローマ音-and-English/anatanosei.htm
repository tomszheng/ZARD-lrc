<p><b>English</b></p>

<p>In the room you returned to, all there was<br>
Was the sounds of the clock ticking the seconds and the TV<br>
The only supporter of this silence is<br>
A girl friend I can talk to<br>
Because I didn't want to become an awful woman<br>
I blurted out "I won't see you any more"</p>

<p>It's not your fault, I'm the one to blame<br>
But still, because the times when<br>
Crying was fun are returning<br>
I'd rather hate you<br>
We can't become anything like friends<br>
A strong rain has started to fall<br>
With that, I'll head towards sleep</p>

<p>We met in the middle of loneliness<br>
As if the breeze from our first summer was talking to us<br>
We were like people so alike<br>
That we saw the same dreams<br>
I suffer because I didn't have the courage<br>
To hurt her and steal you back</p>

<p>It's not your fault, no matter how much I loved you<br>
I can't follow you as you draw further away<br>
This is good-bye<br>
I wonder if I can chase out from my memory<br>
The happy life we spent together<br>
And then someday nostalgically<br>
Embrace this pain?</p>

<p>It's not your fault, I'm the one to blame<br>
But still, because the times when<br>
Crying was fun are returning<br>
I'd rather hate you<br>
We can't become anything like friends<br>
A strong rain has started to fall<br>
With that, I'll head towards sleep</p>
