<p><b>English</b></p>

<p>When I just think of you, my heart grows stronger<br>
I'll always watch over you, so keep on running</p>

<p>Those single-minded dreams<br>
Of that day so long ago are even now dazzling<br>
No matter what worries I'm filled with<br>
I'll believe in the straight path I'm following<br>
I loved your plain, unadorned face...<br>
What's sad is that it's bound to change</p>

<p>They were always so bright<br>
Your eyes when you were a child, my friend<br>
When you were by me, for some reason I could be honest<br>
I want to become the wind that will cross this distance</p>

<p>When it comes to true love<br>
We certainly crossed over various things<br>
So that the tears wouldn't fall like a parade of stars<br>
I took a deep breath<br>
More than the loneliness of being alone<br>
What's sadder is the loneliness when we're together</p>

<p>You were always smiling<br>
Those times when we were together were trying, my friend<br>
When I just think of you, my heart grows stronger<br>
I'll always watch over you, so keep on running</p>

<p>They were always so bright<br>
Your eyes when you were a child, my friend<br>
When I just thought of you, my heart grew stronger<br>
I'll always watch over you, so keep on running</p>

<p>So keep on running...</p>
