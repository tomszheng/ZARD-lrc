<p><b>English</b></p>

<p>You're gone<br>
Even the relationship we had is gone</p>

<p>The truth is I have some regrets<br>
Why was it? That I met you and fell in love<br>
I said nothing, but even though I loved you then<br>
You told so many lies<br>
If my anxieties were to calm<br>
I might need the spice of stimulation</p>

<p>You're gone<br>
You were so kind, but you're gone</p>

<p>The seashore shop we went to so often...<br>
My heart hurts a little everytime I pass by it<br>
When I realized how my happiness was disappearing<br>
I thought that a person can never return<br>
On those unbearable weekends<br>
I should throw away my memories and see a movie</p>

<p>You're gone<br>
Even the relationship we had is gone<br>
It always used to seem like time was passing by<br>
To those times, painfully, I say good-bye</p>

<p>You're gone<br>
Even the relationship we had is gone<br>
It always used to seem like time was passing by<br>
To those times, painfully, I say good-bye</p>
